		<p>Not only are these furry beings my pets, but they are also my friends. They cheer me up when I'm down, with their sweetness and silliness. To add, they are all boys! However, they differ in breed. Dako (big in Bisaya), Coco, and Brownie, respectively, are Asong Pinoys. Ryker, on the other hand, is a Pomeranian and Shih Tzu mix. Despite their differences, they all are very good companions!</p>

<p>Incase you might be wondering why one of them is named Dako. He was actually named by my grandfather. He is the chubbiest among his 5 siblings who were given to our friends, therefore, he is named Dako. </p>
